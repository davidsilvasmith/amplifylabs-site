                        <h2>My Story</h2>
                        <p>I've been building technology solutions for over 20 years, from mobile apps that served millions to trading systems that handled hundreds of millions in transactions.</p>
                        
                        <p>My path started at <strong>Michigan State University (2000-2005)</strong> studying Telecommunications & IT Management. The fundamentals I learned there—systems thinking, process optimization, technology implementation—still guide everything I do.</p>
                        
                        <p>In <strong>2012</strong>, I published <strong>"Professional Mobile Application Development"</strong> with Wrox, covering cross-platform development for Android, iPhone, Windows Phone, and Blackberry. Back when building for multiple platforms was hard, and getting it right mattered.</p>
                        
                        <p>The real test came as <strong>CTO at SPLT</strong>, a Techstars Mobility '15 company. I hired and recruited the technical team, improved team productivity 500% without increasing headcount, reduced defect rates 30%, and eliminated regressions entirely. SPLT was acquired by Bosch in 2017.</p>
                        
                        <p>Since 2017, I've been an <strong>angel investor with the Jason Calacanis Angel Syndicate</strong>. Over 8+ years, I've invested in early-stage tech companies that later raised tens of millions and serve millions of users. Pattern recognition for what works—and what doesn't.</p>
                        
                        <p>I also built <strong>Bitcoin Bulls</strong> (2013-present), designing and building software using exchange APIs. I've traded over $215M+ in notional option value in 2022 alone ($41M+ in 2021), written 173 financial articles with 60K+ views on Benzinga and 500K+ syndicated views on Yahoo Finance and other platforms.</p>
                        
                        <p>Now with <strong>Amplify Labs AI</strong>, I'm applying everything I've learned about building scalable technology solutions to help companies implement AI that drives real business results.</p>

                    <h2>My Philosophy: Build What Works</h2>
                    <p class="hero-subtitle">I'm not interested in AI for AI's sake. I build solutions that solve real problems and create measurable value.</p>
                </div>

                        <h3 class="text-gradient">Hands-On, Not Just Strategy</h3>
                        <p>I don't just make PowerPoint recommendations. I build, deploy, and optimize systems. At SPLT, I didn't just advise on productivity improvements—I implemented the changes that delivered 500% gains.</p>
                        <p>With AI, I take the same approach. Strategy sessions are valuable, but they're just the beginning. I build the agents, integrate the systems, and make sure everything actually works in production.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3 class="text-gradient">Business Results Over Cool Tech</h3>
                        <p>The best technology is invisible. Users don't care about your AI architecture—they care about getting their work done faster, better, cheaper.</p>
                        <p>Every AI solution I build is designed around business outcomes: reducing costs, increasing revenue, improving customer experience, or gaining competitive advantage. If it doesn't move the needle on something that matters, it's not worth building.</p>

                        <p>As a CTO, I've dealt with the pressure of delivering technology solutions that actually work. I understand the gap between what vendors promise and what businesses need.</p>
                        <p>As an investor, I've seen hundreds of pitches and dozens of implementations. I know what separates successful AI deployments from expensive science projects.</p>

                        <p>SPLT didn't just get acquired—we delivered measurable improvements that made the acquisition valuable. 500% productivity improvement, 30% defect reduction, 100% regression elimination.</p>
                        <p>These weren't marketing metrics. They were real operational improvements that translated to business value.</p>

                        <p>I write code, configure systems, and debug production issues. When I recommend an AI solution, it's because I can build it and make it work reliably.</p>
                        <p>This hands-on approach means faster implementation, fewer surprises, and solutions that actually integrate with your existing systems.</p>
